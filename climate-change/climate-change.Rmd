1. Load the .csv file:
```{r}
setwd('/home/GIT/BehavioralBiology')
df <- read.csv('climate-change-data.csv')
```
2. Understand the data

LayDay | Temperature
-----|--------
-0.12|A
-0.18|A
-0.21|A
... | ...
0.15 | B
-0.12 | B
-0.02 | B
_LayDay_ is the day at which the clutch is laid (0.00 = 1st of April), while _Temperature_ is the average day temperature for that day.

3. Chose a suitable statistical test to investigate if the day of clutch lay is significantly different between temperatures. _Hint: the dataset consists of observation at two different temperature_.
```{r}
t.test(LayDay ~ Temperature, data = df)
```

4. Interpret the results.
